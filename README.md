# ðŸ“„ About:
This mod like all other horror mods adds dwellers who want to kill the player. But I assure you that they are not so boring!
# ðŸ‘¹ Creatures:
- The Locust - it spawns at night or in the dark. He's pretty fast and... pretty fast.
- Guilt - a tall, thin... boy? If he sees you, he'll start talking to him and then run to kill you. Chatty!

mod is beta!
