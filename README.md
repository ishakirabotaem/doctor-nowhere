# ðŸ“„ About:
This mod like all other horror mods adds dwellers who want to kill the player. But I assure you that they are not so boring!

# ðŸ‘¹ Creatures:
The Locust - he's hungry. HUNGRY!!!
Guilt - it was all you fault.
Boiled One - umm... red dweller?
ðŸ”® In the future will be more creatures, will be random events and some other cool stuff. Just wait.

If you have any ideas, please suggest them!

mod is PRE-ALPHA!
